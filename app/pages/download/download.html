        Download the latest release!
    </a>
    <p>
        After downloading, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/tree/master/example/timestamp-as-a-service">Example project</a>,
        as well as the <a href="/">Index tutorial</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll also need valid <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/"> Kubectl</a> binaries on your path.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get started, download sanic somewhere on your bin/ directory, i.e., "sudo cp ~/Downloads/sanic /usr/local/bin/"<br>
        The first command you'll likely run is "sanic deploy" to start the kubernetes cluster in your local docker, please have patience because this step only ever needs to be slow once!
