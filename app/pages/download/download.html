    <h2>Sanic is currently only officially supported for GNU/Linux x64</h2>
    <a
            href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/releases/latest/download/sanic"

        Download the latest release!
    </a>
    <p>
        After downloading, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/tree/master/example/timestamp-as-a-service">Example project</a>,
        as well as the <a href="/demo">Interactive tutorial</a> and <a href="/docs/quick-start">quick start guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll also need valid <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/"> Kubectl</a> binaries on your path.
    </p>
    <p>
        All there is to do is add sanic to your PATH, i.e., <code>sudo cp ~/Downloads/sanic /usr/local/bin/</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        After adding sanic to your path, there is no other installation required.
        The first command you'll likely run is "sanic deploy" to start the kubernetes cluster in your local docker, please have patience because this step only ever needs to be slow once!
    </p>
    <h2>Other platforms</h2>
    <p>
        Try <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic">downloading the source code</a> and building it for your own platform!
