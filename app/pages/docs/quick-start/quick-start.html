    <h1>Quick start: Overview of Sanic</h1>
    <p>Sanic is a tool to help you build Docker images and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
    <h2>Sanic's project structure</h2>
    <p>The root of a sanic project is a file called <code>sanic.yaml</code> placed in the same directory as <code>.git</code> with something like the following contents:</p>
    <code class="block">environments:
  dev:
    clusterProvisioner: dummy
    commands:
    - name: tests_for_our_project
      command: echo 'testing dev!'
  prod:
    clusterProvisioner: dummy
    commands:
    - name: tests_for_our_project
      command: echo 'testing prod!'
    </code>
    <p>
        This file is the core of a sanic project: It tells sanic where your project's files are located.
        The <code>environments</code> key describes places you can build and push to.
        In this case, we have two.
    </p>
    <h3>Environment specific commands</h3>
    <p>
        Notice that in the configuration above, we define a command called "tests_for_our_project".
        When we <code>sanic run tests_for_our_project</code>, the command run will change depending on which environment we are in.
        You could use <code>sanic env</code> and <code>sanic run</code> to configure running tests on a per-environment basis.

    <h2>Building and Pushing</h2>
    <p>
        Sanic recursively finds all files called "Dockerfile" in the project directory and builds them when you type <code>sanic build</code>.
        Consider the following directory structure:
<code class="block">project/
  sanic.yaml
  services/
    web/
      Dockerfile
    api/
      Dockerfile
</code>
        In this project, sanic would build images named "web" and "api" if you used <code>sanic build</code>
        The tag for the images would be automatically generated from the current files in the repository.
        To push your images to kubernetes for them to be deployed, simply run <code>sanic build --push</code> to build and push to a registry concurrently.
    </p>

            font-size="1em"
            speed="1.5"

    <h2>Deploying</h2>
    <p>After having built and pushed your images, you'll want to create kubernetes manifests to actually run them in a cluster.</p>
    <p>When you run <code>sanic deploy</code>, Sanic looks for templated kubernetes .yaml files in <code>deploy/in</code> and templates them to the <code>deploy/out</code> directory.</p>
    <p>Sanic then runs <code>sanic kubectl apply -f deploy/out</code>.
