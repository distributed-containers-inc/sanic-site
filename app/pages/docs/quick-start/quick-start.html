    <h1>Quick start: Making a tech company with Kubernetes, Docker, & Sanic</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        It's perfectly to deploy static websites without Docker, Kubernetes, or
        Sanic.
        The difficulty arises when you want to integrate multiple services
        together (i.e., "system design"):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A database like <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> or <a
                href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
        <li>A key-value store like <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a></li>
        <li>A load-balancer and multiple servers for redundancy like <a
                href="http://www.haproxy.org/">haproxy</a> or <a
                href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a></li>
        <li>Logging solutions like <a
                href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> or <a
                href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Kubernetes</b> lets you say, among other things, "I want to run five
        of my webserver, in case a few crash, and automatically send requests to
        one of them"</p>
    <p><b>Docker</b> lets you avoid the pain of "to deploy, download these
        things." Docker images contain all of the necessary libraries and
        configurations for a specific app.</p>
    <p><b>Sanic</b> ties Docker and Kubernetes together, allowing you to quickly
        build & deploy projects using them.</p>
    <p>
        This guide will show you how to make an entire backend for a fictional
        tech company using Docker, Kubernetes, and Sanic on a single server
        in such a way that you could scale to hundreds of servers with ease.</p>
    <p>Note: Even if you aren't planning on making a company any time soon,
        this guide will still be an excellent primer for making backends with
        Docker, Kubernetes, and Sanic.</p>

    <h2>Preparing a computer to use Docker, Kubernetes, and Sanic</h2>
    <p>
        There are some Kubernetes solutions for Windows, but this guide will
        assume you are using either Mac or Linux for your development computer.
        As hinted at in the section above, we'll need to install three
        things:</p>
        <p><b>Kubernetes</b>:
        To interact with kubernetes, you'll need to
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">
            install kubectl</a><br></p>
        <p><b>Docker</b>: Sanic needs
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">Docker</a> installed.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if you're on Linux, you'll need to
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/">
            Allow access to Docker without a password</a></p>
        <p><b>Sanic</b>: Sanic comes as an x86-64 executable.
        You can download
        <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/releases/latest/download/sanic">the latest release here</a>.
        After downloading, put it somewhere on your path, e.g., <code>sudo mv ~/Downloads/sanic /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sanic</code></p>
    </p>
    <h2>Preparing a server to use Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>Kubernetes runs a server called a "kubelet" on each server you want it to know about.
    For this guide, we'll set up 1 server running Ubuntu Linux. If you aren't sure, consider one of the following providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ovh.com/">OVH</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you've paid your servers, you should install Ubuntu Linux on them, steps for this will vary by provider.
        You'll need to install
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/">Docker for Kubernetes</a>,
        as well as
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl">
            Kubenetes itself
        </a> on the server (Your local computer and the server need different software installed, refer to the section above this one.)
    </p>
    <p>Now that everything's installed, you can set up the Kubernetes cluster. On the node, there are a few commands to run (log in as root!):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16</code> -- this sets up a kubelet on your computer with pods having "IPs" from 10.244.0.0 to 10.244.255.255. In practice, this is just a requirement for step #2 below.</li>
        <li><code>KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.7/manifests/canal.yaml</code> --
            kubectl uses a secret key in its configuration to access the cluster, but it looks at ~/.kube/config by default.
            The KUBECONFIG variable tells kubectl to look at /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf, which is where kubeadm put the one for this cluster.
            We do this because <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">Kubernetes need a "networking plugin" set up.</a>  There are many choices, but canal is a good choice if you aren't sure where to start.</li>
        <li><code>KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf kubectl apply -f https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic-site/blob/0ef7f3b9ad234f88ea9b1e1ac169fb17400e42f7/hack/bare-metal-nginx-ingress.yaml</code> --
            this sets up an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Ingress Controller</a> for your cluster.
            These are in charge of routing things to various services.  You'll be able to point /api to one server, and / to another server, for example.
            You can also run multiple domains on the same cluster.</li>
        <li><code>KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-</code> --
            By default, kubeadm "taints" the first nodes (the "master node") as unable to have things scheduled on it.  This is so that a broken container doesn't crash the whole kubernetes cluster, but we'll disable this so that we only need one server. (Note: the trailing dash means "remove this taint")</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interacting with Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>Now that we've installed kubectl on our developer computer and the kubelet (via kubeadm) on the server, we can interact with the production server.</p>
    <p>On your developer, download the configuration with the private key: <code>scp (server user)@(server host) /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/sanic-intro.conf</code></p>
    <p>We should be able to interact with the kubernetes server from the host now: <code>KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/sanic-intro.conf kubectl get nodes</code> should list the one node we've set up so far.</p>
    <p>Of course, you'll likely have a different KUBECONFIG for every cluster (local / staging / CI / production / personal projects / ...), which is the first thing we'll use Sanic to manage:</p>
    <p>Make a new directory somewhere, i.e., <code>mkdir -p ~/projects/sanic-intro && cd ~/projects-sanic-intro</code>
    To turn this into a sanic project, create a new file in this directory called <code>sanic.yaml</code>
    <code class="block">environments:
  dev:
    clusterProvisioner: localdev
  prod:
    clusterProvisioner: external
    clusterProvisionerArgs:
      registry: dummy
      kubeConfig: ~/.kube/sanic-intro.conf</code></p>
    <p>This defines two "environments" for us to build and push to: "dev" is for locally developing & testing our docker images and kubernetes configurations, and "prod" is configured to point to the server we set up in the previous section.</p>
    <p>With our sanic.yaml file configured, we can enter an environment for our project. While in the directory which contains "sanic.yaml", type <code>sanic env prod</code></code></p>
    <p>Notice that Sanic prefixes your terminal prompt with the project (from the name of the directory) and environment you're currently in.</p>
    <p>Test that sanic can successfully connect to the kubernetes cluster, try <code>sanic kubectl get po</code> -- this command is a wrapper around kubectl which sets KUBECONFIG based on which environment you are in.</p>
    <p>Next, let's create a webserver.  Create a new directory called "web" add the Dockerfile & contents from <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/tree/master/example/timestamp-as-a-service/services/web">One of the sanic examples.</a></p>
    <p>Just by having a directory with a Dockerfile in a subdirectory of the "project root" (i.e., where sanic.yaml is), sanic is able to build it.  Give it a try with <code>sanic build</code> -- With only one service, sanic build is just a convenient wrapper for "docker build"</p>
    <p>Sanic has created a unique tag based on the contents of the directory, and then built & loaded the image locally.  You could <code>docker run</code> it now, but let's use kubernetes instead:</p>
    <p>Sanic will, by default, look for kubernetes configurations in deploy/in and then template them using <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">The Go Templating language</a> into deploy/out.</p>
    <p>Let's put the following kubernetes configuration deploy/in/web.yaml.tmpl:</p>
    <code class="block">{{`---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: web
  labels:
    k8s-app: web
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: web
        name: web
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - image: {{getenv "REGISTRY_HOST"}}/web:{{getenv "IMAGE_TAG"}}
        name: web
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80

---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    k8s-app: web
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80

---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: web
          servicePort: 80
`}}</code>
<p>This is a lot of configuration, but it's for a good cause. Let's go through the blocks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Deployment block says to ensure three pods running the image (your registry)/web:(the latest built tag) should always be running, and it has a port at :80 which is used to connect to it</li>
    <li>The Service is a generalization of all of the pods labelled "web" (which were started by the Deployment), it allows you to "curl http://web:80" anywhere in the cluster to connect to one (at random) of the pods.</li>
    <li>The Ingress tells our load balancer (from right after we set up kubernetes on the server) that requests to http://(the server IP) should be forwarded to the web service (and then to one of the pods)</li>
    <li>That is, it goes (client) -> (ingress) -> (service) -> (pod)</li>
    <li>Again, this is quite complicated, but it's necessary to ensure that your infrastructure can scale to dozens of webservers and kubernetes nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>To deploy our webserver to production, we need a registry to push to: A registry is a place you can store your docker images.  For now, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/signup">Sign up for Docker Hub</a></p>
<p>After signing up, there are two steps: One is to tell docker about how to authenticate with Docker Hub with <code>docker login -u (the docker ID you chose)</code></p>
<p>The other is to tell sanic where to push your images to for this project, change <code>registry: dummy</code> to <code>registry: (the docker ID you chose)</code> in <code>sanic.yaml</code>.</p>
<p>With this in place, we can build and push to docker hub with <code>sanic build --push</code></p>
<p>Note: This might take a while, depending on your internet upload speed.</p>
<p>After pushing, we can tell Sanic to build our kubernetes configurations and deploy them with the simple command <code>sanic deploy</code></p>
<p>With all of this in place, you should be able to navigate to http://(your server IP) and see the deployed webserver!</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>By following this guide, you've:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Set up kubectl and docker locally (to enable local kubernetes development)</li>
    <li>Installed kubernetes on a server</li>
    <li>Set up a production environment and sanic repository, and</li>
    <li>Deployed a single-image app to the production server using the sanic configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>For next steps, try running <code>sanic build --push && sanic deploy</code> after entering the dev environment with <code>sanic env dev</code> -- this allows you to test locally before pushing to production</p>
<p>For multi-node deployments, run the <code>kubeadm join</code> command printed when you <code>kubeadm init</code>-ed on each of the new servers you want to add.  Pods will automatically schedule to new nodes!</p>
<p>To continue adding services, look at the redis & api server services (services/ & deploy/in/web.yaml.tmpl) in <a href="https://github.com/distributed-containers-inc/sanic/tree/master/example/timestamp-as-a-service">the timestamp-as-a-service example</a></p>
<p>Finally, if you run into any issues with kubernetes, docker, or sanic, please get in touch with Colin &lt;<a href="mailto:me@colinchartier.com">me@colinchartier.com</a>&gt;, the author of this guide!</p>
